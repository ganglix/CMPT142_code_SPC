# This demonstration shows you how to call methods on string objects.

# Let's do this in the interactive mode in console

# initialize some variables to play with
url = "www.engineering.usask.ca"

# find the location of the first period in the url

# count the number of periods in the url
# (function not covered in readings)

#
# remove white space
# .strip(), .rstrip(), .lstrip()
#
# count the number of characters in the url after removing "www."
# (gotta be careful - donâ€™t just assume a function does what you think!)  usb-str vs. chars
# args are that chars considered as "garbage

# # more methods:

# when are they useful
# immutable, they create a copy


# how do I know what kind of methods are out there? How do I know the syntax/usage?
