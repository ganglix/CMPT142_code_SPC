# Suppose you have a dictionary of survey responses:
# •keys are student names
# •values are favourite ice cream flavours (one of
# "chocolate", "vanilla", "strawberry")
# Write a function that takes a dictionary of survey responses
# and returns a new dictionary where:
# •keys are ice cream flavours
# •values are number of students with that favourite flavour
