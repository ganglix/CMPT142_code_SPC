# while vs. for
# In this demonstration, weâ€™ll see a situation where using a
# while-loop is preferable to using a for-loop.

# password example

# initiate param
passcode = "cmpt142"
max_attempts = 3

# ask user to input passcode

# print message to user
# when while loop is done, there are two outcomes
