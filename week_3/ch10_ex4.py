# List music contains sublists of songs. Song sublists have the
# format [title, rating, genre]:
# e.g. [ ["One",4,"Metal"], ["Happy",3,"Pop"], ... ]
# Use list comprehensions to create list best_playlist for
# songs where:
# • rating is either 4 or 5; AND...
# • genre is either "Metal" or "Hard Rock"


# Topic : List Comprehensions ( Selection )
# list of sublists of a user ’s songs containing [title , rating , genre ]

# the brackets work across multiple lines, so the one-liner list comprehension can be written in many lines
