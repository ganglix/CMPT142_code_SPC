# Recall the three types of looping tasks from the readings:
# 1) counting, 2) iteration over a sequence, and
# 3) everything else. For each scenario, what type of looping
# problem are we facing?

# (a) Letting a human type in six winning lottery numbers from the console.


# (b) Counting how many numbers between 500 and 1000 are prime.
