# Lists contain data. Often, graphing data can be useful!
# List flu_data contains the number of positive flu tests each
# day for the past 60 days
# Letâ€™s plot a graph with the day on the x-axis and flu cases on
# the y-axis.
# e.g. flu_cases = [13, 14, 9, ... 325]

flu_case = [13, 14, 9, 16, 10, 18, 22, 19, 16, 22,
             24, 48, 34, 25, 17, 29, 33, 35, 28, 43,
             59, 44, 55, 63, 61, 48, 68, 61, 70, 76,
             78, 74, 87, 101, 120, 128, 105, 109, 120, 124,
             111, 128, 120, 133, 134, 139, 127, 130, 141, 147,
             439, 236, 218, 209, 213, 244, 329, 197, 351, 325]
